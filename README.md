# Indy Node Docker Container Working Group

This is the work bench of the Docker Container Working Group of the [ID Union project](https://github.com/IDunion). The primary goal of this working group is to develop an [Hyperledger Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) Docker Image with minimal dependencies.

The primary artifact are the container images at https://github.com/orgs/IDunion/packages/container/package/indy-node-container%2Findy_node which are build from the files in [the build folder](build/).

We also provide a few [utility scripts, including a docker-compose file](run/) to help setting up a runtime environment for the containers.
See here for instructions how to setup and run the indy node images from this repository.
